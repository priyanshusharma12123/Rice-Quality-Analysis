# Rice quality analysis through image processing
We analyse the quality of rice by calculating the average length/breadth ratio for each rice grain. We use **Image processing** Based on this ratio, rice quality can be graded. For Proper implemetnation use Google Colab or Anaconda for local implementation. We are using `openCV`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries in `Python 2`.

## Running Locally
```
- clone this repo
- install the necessary libraries
